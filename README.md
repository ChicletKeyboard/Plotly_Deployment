# Plotly_Deployment
Creating custom dashboard from JSON file to visualize research data on Bellybutton biodiversity among multiple test subjects.

The goal of this analysis is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis includes three charts: 
1. A [bar chart](https://github.com/ChicletKeyboard/Plotly_Deployment/blob/58175223e1578f073ea292c9d4efc3aa4ebb03de/resources/bar_chart.jpg) that illustrates the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the belly button.
2. A [bubble chart](https://github.com/ChicletKeyboard/Plotly_Deployment/blob/58175223e1578f073ea292c9d4efc3aa4ebb03de/resources/bubble_chart.jpg) that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample.
3. A [gauge chart](https://github.com/ChicletKeyboard/Plotly_Deployment/blob/58175223e1578f073ea292c9d4efc3aa4ebb03de/resources/gauge_chart.jpg) indicating the number of times a volunteer washes their belly button.

By choosing a volunteer ID (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences among multiple test subjects.
